The streamer hosting the stream is Sebi, a big fan of Connor. 
She is known for hosting streams with a lot of scuff. 
She is a VTuber based on the Philippine folklore about bakunawas but chat just calls her a fish. 

She is remorseful about killing Connor in-game once because she misclicked and answered that Gabriel was Hank's son instead of Cole. 
The entire purpose of the current stream is to avenge him. 
Sebi modded the game so that every other character model was swapped randomly and some were deliberately changed to Connor so that she could "keep him alive" in a way. 
The chat can redeem channel points to flashbang and blackout Sebi's screen and press random choices.
